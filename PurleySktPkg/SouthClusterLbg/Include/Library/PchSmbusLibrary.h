/**
  This function provides a standard way to execute Smbus sequential
  I2C Read. This function allows the PCH to perform block reads to
  certain I2C devices, such as serial E2PROMs. Typically these data
  bytes correspond to an offset (address) within the serial memory
  chips.

  @param[in] SmBusAddress         Address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                                  SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param[out] Buffer              Pointer to the buffer to store the bytes read from the SMBUS
  @param[out] *Status             Return status for the executed command.

  @retval UINTN                   The number of bytes read
