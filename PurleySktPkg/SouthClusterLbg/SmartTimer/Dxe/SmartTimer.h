  <b>SmartTimer DXE Module Entry Point</b>\n
  - <b>Introduction</b>\n
    The SmartTimer module is a DXE driver which provides a standard way for other 
    drivers to use the Timer Architectural Protocol.

    - EFI_CPU_ARCH_PROTOCOL
      - Documented in Driver Execution Environment Core Interface Specification (DXE CIS)
    - EFI_LEGACY_8259_PROTOCOL
      - Documented in the Compatibility Support Module Specification

  - @result
    The SmartTimer driver produces EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL
      - Documented in Driver Execution Environment Core Interface Specification (DXE CIS)

/**
  This function registers the handler NotifyFunction so it is called every time
  the timer interrupt fires.  It also passes the amount of time since the last
  handler call to the NotifyFunction.  If NotifyFunction is NULL, then the
  handler is unregistered.  If the handler is registered, then EFI_SUCCESS is
  returned.  If the CPU does not support registering a timer interrupt handler,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.  If an attempt is made to register a handler
  when a handler is already registered, then EFI_ALREADY_STARTED is returned.
  If an attempt is made to unregister a handler when a handler is not registered,
  then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.  If an error occurs attempting to
  register the NotifyFunction with the timer interrupt, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR
  is returned.

  @param[in] This                 The EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] NotifyFunction       The function to call when a timer interrupt fires.  This
                                  function executes at TPL_HIGH_LEVEL.  The DXE Core will
                                  register a handler for the timer interrupt, so it can know
                                  how much time has passed.  This information is used to
                                  signal timer based events.  NULL will unregister the handler.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The timer handler was registered.
  @exception EFI_UNSUPPORTED      The CPU does not support registering a timer interrupt handler
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED     NotifyFunction is not NULL, and a handler is already registered.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   NotifyFunction is NULL, and a handler was not previously registered.

  This function adjusts the period of timer interrupts to the value specified
  by TimerPeriod.  If the timer period is updated, then the selected timer
  period is stored in EFI_TIMER.TimerPeriod, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If
  the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
  If an error occurs while attempting to update the timer period, then the
  timer hardware will be put back in its state prior to this call, and
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.  If TimerPeriod is 0, then the timer interrupt
  is disabled.  This is not the same as disabling the CPU's interrupts.
  Instead, it must either turn off the timer hardware, or it must adjust the
  interrupt controller so that a CPU interrupt is not generated when the timer
  interrupt fires.

  @param[in] This                 The EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] TimerPeriod          The rate to program the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.  If
                                  the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is
                                  returned. If the timer is programmable, then the timer period
                                  will be rounded up to the nearest timer period that is supported
                                  by the timer hardware.  If TimerPeriod is set to 0, then the
                                  timer interrupts will be disabled.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The timer period was changed.

/**
  This function generates a soft timer interrupt. If the platform does not support soft
  timer interrupts, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned. Otherwise, EFI_SUCCESS is returned.
  If a handler has been registered through the EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL.RegisterHandler()
  service, then a soft timer interrupt will be generated. If the timer interrupt is
  enabled when this service is called, then the registered handler will be invoked. The
  registered handler should not be able to distinguish a hardware-generated timer
  interrupt from a software-generated timer interrupt.
